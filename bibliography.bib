On the basis of this definition he has proposed to consider those elements of a given large finite population to be random whose complexity is maximal. Almost all elements of the population have a complexity which is close to the maximal value. In this paper it is shown that the random elements as defined by Kolmogorov possess all conceivable statistical properties of randomness. They can equivalently be considered as the elements which withstand a certain universal stochasticity test. The definition is extended to infinite binary sequences and it is shown that the non random sequences form a maximal constructive null set. Finally, the Kollektivs introduced by von Alises obtain a definition which seems to satisfy all intuitive requirements.},

Like the Hilbert type systems of first order predicate logic that are used, the theories of single and iterated generalized inductive definitions formulated do not lend themselves immediately to a proof theoretical analysis. Therefore, the chapter reformulates the axioms expressing the principles of definition and proof by generalized induction as rules of inference similar to those introduced by Gentzen in his system of natural deduction for first order predicate logic. As in Gentzen's case, this reformulation leads to a notable systematization that is already in the case of ordinary inductive definitions, the rules corresponding to the axioms that express the principle of definition by induction appearing as introduction rules for the inductively defined predicates, whereas the axioms that express the principle of proof by induction give rise to the corresponding elimination rules. Moreover, the generalized inductive definitions appear as inductive definitions iterated once and the iterated generalized inductive definitions as inductive definitions iterated twice or more.},

Also related, although less closely, are the type and logic free theories of constructions of Kreisel 1962 and 1965 and Goodman 1970. In its first version, the present theory was based on the strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types whatsoever, which is at the same time a type and an object of that type. This axiom had to be abandoned, however, after it was shown to lead to a contradiction by Jean Yves Girard. I am very grateful to him for showing me his paradox. The change that it necessitated is so drastic that my theory no longer contains intuitionistic simple type theory as it originally did. Instead, its proof theoretic strength should be close to that of predicative analysis.},

This measure, which is called the redundancy, appears in two versions, one microcanonical (or combinatorial) and the other canonical (or parametrical). The microcanomical redundancy is obtained by dividing minus the logarithm of the critical level by the Boltzmann entropy of the experiment and the canonical redundancy by dividing minus the logarithm of the likelihood ratio by the Gibbsian entropy. An approximation theorem shows that the former may be approximated asymptotically by the latter. The problem of calibrating the redundancy scale is discussed in connection with a series of examples, and, finally, certain considerations concerning the size of a statistical experiment are given which are based on the redundancy rather than the power function.},

The language of the theory is richer than the languages of traditional intuitionistic systems in permitting proofs to appear as parts of propositions so that the propositions of the theory can express properties of proofs. There are axioms for universes that link the generation of objects and types and play somewhat the same role for the present theory as does the replacement axiom for Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The present theory is based on a strongly impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types in symbols. This axiom has to be abandoned, however, after it has been shown to lead to a contraction. This chapter discusses Normalization theorem, which can be strengthened in two ways: it can be made to cover open terms and it can be proved that every reduction sequence starting from an arbitrary term leads to a unique normal term after a finite number of steps. The definition of the notion of convertibility and the proof that an arbitrary term is convertible can no longer be separated because the type symbols and the terms are generated simultaneously.},

Because of the correspondence between lambda terms and natural deductions, this change is equally called for in Prawitz's definition of convertibility for natural deductions. The chapter also outlines that the transition to intuitionistic abstractions on the metalevel is essential and nontrivial; essential, because they are the most fruitful notion of model, the interpretation of the convertibility relation conv, is standard, that is, it is interpreted as definitional equality in the model, and definitional equality is a notion that is unmentionable within the classical set theoretic framework.},

	abstract = {Since this lecture is called the Beth lecture, It is natural to ask oneself what connection is there between Beth and intuitionism? and, to my mind, the most obvious answer is: the Beth models for intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic. I would like to remind you of a certain picture that we all use when thinking in terms of possible worlds, namely the picture in which we are always at a certain stage, considering a number of possible future alternatives, and then one of those alternatives is realized and we get to a new stage, at which we are faced with some other alternatives, one of those alternatives materializes, and then the whole process continues in the same way. That means that, at each moment, we are at the end of a certain path, which I will draw by a thick line, symbolizing that which has already materialized, and we are considering all possible future alternatives, one of those alternatives materializes, as a result of which the thick path gets extended, and then the pattern repeats itself: Open image in new window We all think in terms of this picture: it underlies possible world semantics, and it is natural to ask: where does it really come from? I mean: who had this picture for the first time? Most of us have probably met it in connection with Kripke semantics (Kripke 1965), but actually Kripke semantics was predated by Beth semantics by a couple of years: Beth’ papers were published in 1956 and 1959 (Beth 1956a, 1959), and Beth in turn drew on Brouwer here, because he took the nodes, or stages, to form a spread in Brouwer’s sense (Brouwer 1918B).},

It is therefore very natural to ask how these two forms of verificationism are related to one another: was the verificationism that we had in the 1930s a kind of forerunner of what we have now, or was it something entirely different? I would like to discuss this question by considering a very particular problem, which was at the heart of Schlick’s interests, namely, the problem whether there might exist undecidable propositions or, if you prefer, unsolvable problems or unanswerable questions: it is merely a matter of wording which of these terms you choose. As I said, it is a problem which was at the heart of Schlick’s interests: it is explicitly discussed already in his early, programmatic paper Die Wende in der Philosophie in the first volume of Erkenntnis from 1930, and there is a short later paper, which has precisely Unanswerable Questions? as its title, from 1935, and he discussed it on several occasions in between also.},
